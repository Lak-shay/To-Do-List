# To-Do-List
In this project, we have made a list using C++ and Stack data structure which manages the tasks entered by the user in the list. The user can modify the list as per 
his/her requirement.
I have given options to the user like insert tasks, remove tasks, remove a task from a specefic location and display the pending list. Concepts of OOPS like pointers are
used.
